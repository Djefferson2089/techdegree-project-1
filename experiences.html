        <h2>Data Deficiency Analyst</h2>
        <p>After spending 3 years as an aircraft mechanic I got the priviledge to expand my knowledge and work with some great people. I became a data analyst for 2 years. Some daily tasks included maintaining, troubleshooting, and providing database user support for a database with hundreds of users. As well as organizing and chairing monthly and quarterly meetings focused on trending deficiencies and solutions.</p>

        <h2>Aircraft Mechanic</h2>
        <p>With the help of my dad I joined the Air Force in 2012 and became a 5th generation tactical aircraft mechanic where I helped maintain 46 F-22s for 3 years. Some daily tasks included conducting pre-flight, thru-flight, and post-flight aircraft inspections. As well as servicing the necessary fluids that ensured mission capable aircraft for the pilots.</p>
